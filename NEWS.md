# gridmicrotex 0.0.4

- Accept raw latex code from other package, liek `xtable::print.xtable()` / `knitr::kable()` / booktabs output.
- New MicroTeX commands `\thickhline` and `\cline{a-b}`.
- New `itemize` and `enumerate` list environments. Lists may nest.
- Bug fix: `$…$` inside tabular cells no longer chops the table.
- Bug fix: starred alignment envs (`align*`, `eqnarray*`, …) now render.
- Bug fix: `latex_wrap()` is now vectorised over its input, matching its
  documented contract, and errors on `NA` input instead of rendering "NA".
- Bug fix: the `\mark{}` macro survives a `microtex_release()` /
  re-init cycle.
- `gp$col` transparency is now honoured (alpha passed through to MicroTeX).
- Macro expansion warns on circular definitions instead of silently
  producing wrong output.

# gridmicrotex 0.0.3

- Self-contained `load_font()` example so CRAN's donttest additional checks no longer fail on the unreliable CTAN font download.
- New commands.

# gridmicrotex 0.0.2

- Support the `\def` command
- New function `grobMark`.
- Bug fix `ggplot2` intergration.
- Bug fix coloring body.
- `ggplot2` integration respects `latex_options`.
- Defer `systemfonts` registration of the bundled Lete and STIX fonts to first render. This avoids the `XType: Using static font registry.` notice that older macOS SDKs emit on Core Text font registration, which had caused spurious WARN/NOTEs on `r-oldrel-macos-arm64`.

# gridmicrotex 0.0.1
